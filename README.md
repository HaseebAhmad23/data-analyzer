# Data Analyzer

A personal project to build chatbot with analyze data with OpenAI and LangChain. The idea is simple — you either upload a PDF or drop in a website URL, and then you can chat with an AI about whatever is in that document or page. Built with FastAPI on the backend and Vue 3 on the frontend.
